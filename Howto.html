<h1> Movement</h1>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> The first thing you need to learn is how to move. Move the directional stick left or right to move. You can also run by pushing the directional stick all the way in one direction. <br>

<h1> Jumping</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> The second basic movement and probably the most important is jumping. To do this simply press the Y button. You can press the button again in the air to double jump. <br>

<h1> Attacking</h1>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> The next thing you want to be able to do is attack your opponent. To do this press the A button in the direction of your opponent. Here's where things
 get a little more complicated. Each direction has a different attack when you press the A button and each characters attacks look different from on another, so you need to get used to your character and what his attack look like. Below I will explain each type of attack<br>
<h1>Jab or Neutral Attack</h1>
If you simply press the A button you will do a standard neutral attack. With some characters you can also hold the button and they will do a flurry of jab attacks. This attack is relatively weak but can be used in some combo's<br>
