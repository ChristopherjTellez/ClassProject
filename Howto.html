<h1> Movement</h1>
 <p> The first thing you need to learn is how to move. Move the directional stick left or right to move. You can also run by pushing the directional stick all the way in one direction. <br>

<h1> Jumping</h1>
<p> The second basic movement and probably the most important is jumping. To do this simply press the Y button. You can press the button again in the air to double jump. <br>

<h1> Attacking</h1>
 <p> The next thing you want to be able to do is attack your opponent. To do this press the A button in the direction of your opponent. Here's where things
 get a little more complicated. Each direction has a different attack when you press the A button and each characters attacks look different from on another, so you need to get used to your character and what his attack look like. Below I will explain each type of attack<br>
</p>
<h1>Neutral Attacks</h1>
<p>If you simply press the A button you will do a standard neutral attack. With some characters you can also hold or mash and you will do a flurry of jab attacks. This attack is relatively weak but can be used in some combo's. You can also do a neutral attack in the air by jumping and pressing A with no other imputs.<br>

<h1>Directional/Tilt Attacks</h1>
<p>To perform a tilt attack you just need to hold the direction you want to attack and press the A attack. Even though you have 4 directions, your left and right attack are the same.
This means you have an up-tilt, down-tilt and forward-tilt/side-tilt attacks. These attacks come out faster than most attacks depending on the character you you should be using them the most when you're on the ground.
I good tip is to set your C-stick to perform tilt moves, this way you just need to hit the c-stick to do the moves instead of using the directional stick which might cause you to dod unwanted movements or attacks.<br>

<h1>Dash Attack</h1>
<p> A dash attack is done by running in a direction while pressing the A button. You don't even need to be running for a while, as long as your character enters the running animation you will perform
    a dash attack when you press the A button. It is important that if you do not want to perform a dash attack while you're running at your opponent you should stop yourself first. The quckest way to stop yourself in a run is to press the down direction briefly then you can
    do any other move you want.</p><iframe src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HelplessUnevenAllosaurus-mobile.mp4" title="description"> </iframe><br>

<h1> Smash Attacks</h1>
<p>Smash attacks are your strongest moves and are usually your kill moves. To perform a smash attack you want to move your directional stick in one of the 4 directions and press the A button at the same time. After you hit the directions stick and A button you can also hold the A button to charge the smash attack to make it stronger. Just don't hold it too long or your opponent will see it coming a mile away and will punish you for it.<br>

<h1>Special Attacks</h1>
<p>The most unique attacks in the game are from your special attacks. To perform a special attacks you can press the B button or B+Any direction. Each character has a very unique set of special attacks, so it's really down to you to learn what each one does. Special attacks can also be used in the air which adds a whole dimension of attacks you need to pay attention to. <br>

<h1>Air Attacks</h1>
<p>Just like the name implies air attacks are attacks you do while you're in the air. Instead of your side attack being the same however you now have a back air (bair) and a forward air (fair). You also have an up air and down air. Air attacks are probably the most important attacks you can do in the game and you should really practice your movement in the air and attacking to get used to the timing of when the attacks come out.<br>
</p><iframe src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ImperturbableDopeyCygnet-mobile.mp4" title="description"> </iframe>
<h1>Shield/Guard</h1>
<p>To block you need to press either the right or left triggers. Holding the right or left triggers creates a bubble around your character. The longer you hold it the smaller the bubble gets. The shield allows you to block attacks, but each attack that hits your shield makes it smaller.
   </p><iframe src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BlueBlankAiredaleterrier-mobile.mp4" title="description"> </iframe> <br>
<p> If your shield gets to small it will break and you will be unable to move your character for some time allowing your opponent to do whatever they want to you.</p>
<iframe src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SpiritedWeeCavy-mobile.mp4" title="description"> </iframe>
<p> While you are shielding if you move your control stick left or right you can perform a roll that gives you a small bit of invincibility and allows you to move yourself to a better position. You should not spam roll however because eventually it will become slower and slower and you will be much easier to hit.</p>

<h1>Grabs</h1>
<p>To perform a grab you need to press the left or right bumpers or the Z button on the gamecube controller. This move is used to grab your opponent. Grabbing them makes them unable to move for some time. By pressing the A button while you
    are grabbing someone you can pummel them. Pummeling is when you hit your opponent when you are grabbing them. You can also throw your opponent in the 4 directions by moving your directional stick in the desired direction. these throws can be useful to start combos or even knocking out your opponent.</p><iframe src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmlessUnselfishLeopard-mobile.mp4" title="description"> </iframe><br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>With all these basics under you belt you can go out and play the game. Run around and try using every move to get a good feel for it. The most important part about getting good at the game is becoming comfortable with your character and how they move around on the stage. Test out your moves and learn what types of limits your character has. Different characters have different jumps and recovery options so it's important to test and become familiar with them.<br>
