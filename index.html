<h1>Welcome to Christopher Tellez's class project Page!</h1>
<p>My name is Christopher James Tellez, I am originally from San Diego California and spent 20 years of my life there. After I graduated High School I started attending college but did'nt have a clear goal in mind. I took two years of college courses until I eventually joined the Air Force</p>
