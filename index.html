<h2>Hobbies<h2>
  <p> My hobbies are watching movies, playing video games, binge watching T.V. Shows. <br> I love watching movies, one of my favorite movies is V for Vendetta. <br> I play a lot of games but the one game I'm really into is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. <br> Lastly I enjoy binge watching shows, the last show I binge watched was the first season of The Boys and I'm planning to do the same once the rest of season 2 is out <br> </p>
