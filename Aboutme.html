<h1>Welcome to Christopher Tellez's class project Page!</h1>
<p>My name is Christopher James Tellez, I am originally from San Diego California and I have been in the Air Force for almost 11 years. <br>I was stationed at Nellis AFB for a long 9 years working on F-15C/D and E models before I made it out to Yokota AFB in Japan 
  <br>where I am currently stationed working on C-130J's. I was really excited to be able to go to Japan and have enjoyed my stay so far. <br></p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p> My hobbies are watching movies, playing video games, binge watching T.V. Shows. 
<br> I love watching movies, one of my favorite movies is V for Vendetta. I have seen this movie at least 10 times. <br>
I enjoy binge watching shows, the last show I watched was the first season of The Boys and I'm planning to do the same once the rest of season 2 is out. <br>It's a very interesting take on super heroes and has you on the edge of your seat through most of it. <br> 
Lastly, I play a lot of games but the one game I'm really into is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I'm not good enough to go to tournaments but I'm pretty ok. <br>I have been playing Ultimate since it came out but have been an avid smash player ever since it came out on the gamecube with Super Smash Bros. Melee <br>
