<h1 style="text-align:center;">About me!</h1>
<br>
 <br><p style="text-align:center;">My name is Christopher James Tellez, I am originally from San Diego California and I have been in the Air Force for almost 11 years. I was stationed at Nellis AFB for a long 9 years working on F-15C/D and E models before I made it out to Yokota AFB in Japan 
  where I am currently stationed working on C-130J's. I was really excited to be able to go to Japan and have enjoyed my stay so far. As far is my future is concerned, I'm planning to stay until I hit my 20 year mark and retiring. </p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hobbies</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"> My hobbies are watching movies, playing video games, binge watching T.V. Shows. 
 I love watching movies, one of my favorite movies is V for Vendetta. I have seen this movie at least 10 times. 
I enjoy binge watching shows, the last show I watched was the first season of The Boys and I'm planning to do the same once the rest of season 2 is out. It's a very interesting take on super heroes and has you on the edge of your seat through most of it. 
Lastly, I play a lot of games but the one game I'm really into is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I'm not good enough to go to tournaments but I'm pretty ok. I have been playing Ultimate since it came out but have been an avid smash player ever since it came out on the gamecube with Super Smash Bros. Melee.
