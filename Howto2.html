            <h1>Short Hops</h1>
            <p> You can perform a short hop by lightly tapping the jump button for less than 3 frames or by pressing 2 jump buttons at the same time. The short hop is roughly half
            the height of a normal jump and allows you to move more precicely through the air. A full hop can put you really high up in the air and vulnerable to an opponents attacks.
            Use short hops to position yourself better. You can also use short hops while attacking to catch your opponent off guard or to extend combos. </p>
             <br>
             <h1> Fast Falling</h1>
            <p> You can perform a fast fall by holding down at the apex of your jump. Fast falling can be used to return to the ground quickly so you can either jump again to a better positon or to
             resume an attack on your opponent. Fast falling can also be used while you're attack so you can throw out an attack with a lot of active frames and hit you opponent while falling to the ground.</p> 
             <br>
             <h1>Perfect block/Parry</h1>
             <p>To perform a perfect block or Parry you must release the shield button just as your opponents attack is about to hit your shield. This allows you to move immediately move
             after the parry while your oppent is still in the attack animation. You can then punish your opponent out of the parry and gain the advantage.</P><br>
<h1>B-reversing</h1>
<p> A B reverse is when you do a special move using B but instead of it coming out the way you are facing it comes out in the oposite direction. This works with almost every B move and to accomplish this you must imput the speacial move you want to do then quickly input the opposite direction that your are moving in or facing.
    This move is very useful for tricking your opponent.<p><br>
<h1>Reverse Aerial Rush</h1>
<p>A reverse aerial rush or RAR is when you want to hit an opponent that is in front of you with a back air. To do this move as you are running at your opponent in the moment right before you jump
    you need to press your directional stick in the opposite direction then jump. Right as you press the jump button you need to move the stick back in the direction you were going. This will allow you to maintain the momentum you had going forward but now you back is to the opponent.
    With this you can now do a back air. this technique is useful because you back air is usually one of the strongest aerials in your arsenal so for some early kills try to use this technique.</p><br>
<h1>Teching</h1>
<p>Teching or a tech is when you break your fall after being hit by an attack that would otherwise cause you to hit the ground. When you get hit by an attack that sends you flying into the ground usually your character will hit the ground and bounce, this would allow your opponent
    to follow up and hit you more while you are affected by the lag or the recovery your character is going through. To tech you need to press the shield button right before you hit the ground, it's a very small window (about 11 frames). Successfully teching will make your character grab the ground essentially and 
    keep you upright and gives you faster recovery. You can also perform this move if you get hit against the side of a stage. Usually if you get hit under or off the stage back into the underside or side of the stage you'll bounce off it and get sent into the blast zone. But, if you tech you can grab the stage and be able to recover back to the ledge.</p><br>
