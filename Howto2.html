            <h1>Short Hops</h1>
            <p> You can perform a short hop by lightly tapping the jump button for less than 3 frames or by pressing 2 jump buttons at the same time. The short hop is roughly half
            the height of a normal jump and allows you to move more precicely through the air. A full hop can put you really high up in the air and vulnerable to an opponents attacks.
            Use short hops to position yourself better. You can also use short hops while attacking to catch your opponent off guard or to extend combos. </p>
             <br>
             <h1> Fast Falling</h1>
            <p> You can perform a fast fall by holding down at the apex of your jump. Fast falling can be used to return to the ground quickly so you can either jump again to a better positon or to
             resume an attack on your opponent. Fast falling can also be used while you're attack so you can throw out an attack with a lot of active frames and hit you opponent while falling to the ground.</p> 
             <br>
             <h1>Perfect block/Parry</h1>
             <p>To perform a perfect block or Parry you must release the shield button just as your opponents attack is about to hit your shield. This allows you to move immediately move
             after the parry while your oppent is still in the attack animation. You can then punish your opponent out of the parry and gain the advantage.</P>
