            <h1>Stock</h1>
            <p> A stock is just your lives and they normally appear at the bottom near your charatcers percentage. Stock matches are the perfered style in tournaments and usually each character has 3 stocks in an Ultimate match.</p>

<h1>Neutral</h1>
            <p> Neutral is an interesting word, it can mean a lot of things, even in smash. We're not talking about your neutral attacks when you pres A on the ground or in the air, we're talking about
            a concept for winning a fight. In smash when someone talks about neutral or winning neutral it actually means getting the uper hand against your opponent. When both character spawn on stage and they are opposite eachother,
            THIS is neutral and the way to win the match is to win neutral. Once a character has been knocked to a side of the stage or even off stage, they have lost neutral and are now at a disadvantaged state where then can be
           lose a stock more easily. The one in the advantage has won neutral and now controls the stage and usining their many skills can find a way to further damage their opponent or even take their stock. That's what neutral is. </p>

<h1>Directional Influence (DI)</h1>
<p>Directional influence or DI is the control a player has while they are being attacked. Usually when you are hit by an attack you get sent in a direction, you are actually able to influence and alter your trajectory by moving you control stick in a certain direction.
    You can actually die faster if you DI in the direction of the blast zone, usually that's bad DI. But, you can also save yourself from a move that should have killed you by performing good DI. You just need to move your control stick so that your trajectory move you the farthest way away from the blast zone.
    It is really important to be mindful of when you are hit by an attack and try to move in a direction that won't get yourself killed.</p><br>
