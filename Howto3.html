            <h1>Neutral</h1
            <p> Neutral is an interesting word, it can mean a lot of things, even in smash. We're not talking about your neutral attacks when you pres A on the ground or in the air, we're talking about
            a concept for winning a fight. In smash when someone talks about neutral or winning neutral it actually means getting the uper hand against your opponent. When both character spawn on stage and they are opposite eachother,
            THIS is neutral and the way to win the match is to win neutral. Once a character has been knocked to a side of the stage or even off stage, they have lost neutral and are now at a disadvantaged state where then can be
           lose a stock more easily. The one in the advantage has won neutral and now controls the stage and usining their many skills can find a way to further damage their opponent or even take their stock. That's what neutral is. </p>
